   <h2>Wand</h2> 
   <p>A lot of people would argue that one Hallow rises above and beyond the others – the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny. So legendary is this wand that it has acquired many names throughout the centuries, but ultimately, only one exists.   </p>

   <h2>Stone</h2> 
   <p>No spell can reawaken the dead’, Dumbledore once told Harry – although this legendary stone possesses magic that comes close. As told in ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’, the Resurrection Stone has the power to bring loved ones back from the grave </p>

   <h2>Cloak</h2> 
   <p>So funny to think that we were introduced to a Hallow so early in Harry’s adventures – in fact, the very first book. Funnier still, to think that Harry used one of the most powerful and rare objects in the world to basically sneak around Hogwarts </p>
